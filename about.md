I am **Yanran Li**, a second-year PhD student at PolyU (Hong Kong). My supervisor is [Prof. Wenjie Li](http://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~cswjli/). See my [resume](/files/Resume_Yanran_Li.pdf). My research interests are mainly about language generation and general Deep Learning in NLP.

On this blog, I mostly write about Natural Language Processing, Machine Conversation, Deep Learning, and issues with *R* language.

Before PolyU, I got my Bachelor degree from the Centre of Information Science, School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), Peking University. I work with [Prof. Sujian Li](http://www.icl.pku.edu.cn/member/lisujian/maincontent.htm) and [Prof. Wenjie Li](http://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~cswjli/).

### misc

As I didn't want my about page to be a direct result of boredom, I concluded that the best way I can think of to describe myself is to list all of the things that make me happy. So in no particular order, here it goes: 

**Books (mostly Literatures). Arts (I also paint). Running. Family & Friends. Traveling. A good Sunday sunshine. Hand lettering. Coffee. Dancing (I used to dance). Gardening (I'd like to be my career). The smell of fresh flowers.**

### Traveling photos

Traveling in Italy made my summer in 2015. 

Genova is a small city with a fantastic Acquarium.

I named this photo taken in Genova's Acquarium, *Solitude*.

Also, except Rome, one cannot miss Venice and its Burano...

Florence is my favourite city, a flowery and charming city. I wanna make my holiday everytime here..

Especially the morning and the river I lived near, it reminds me of the pictures of my favourite artist, [*Rembrand*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rembrandt).

> *It's morning. And morning is amazing. It's when we charge into the future. When we blasted off for the moon.*    
*Scaled the highest peak. And flew for the very first time. Morning starts, and changes everything.*    
*It's a clean slate. A fresh start.*   
*So come dreamers, and trailblazers, champions. Come builders.*       
*It's morning, wake up, and be amazing.*
